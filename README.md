# Language Similarity using LCS

This project explores the linguistic relationship between the Kamba and Kikuyu languages using the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** algorithm at the character level — including spaces.

## 📚 Project Overview

- Translate the English sentence **"these seven big trees"** into Kamba and Kikuyu.
- Apply the LCS algorithm to measure textual similarity.
- Build a Python program to compute LCS for any pair of sentences.
- Reflect on the linguistic implications of the results.

## 🚀 Features

- Character-level LCS computation (spaces included)
- Input support for any two sentences
- Output of both the LCS string and its length

## 🛠️ Usage
